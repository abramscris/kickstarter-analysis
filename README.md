Is strongly recommended that Louise start her Theater Play Campaigned in the months of May, June, and July. Looking at the lower success rates falling in January, February, August, September, and October, with the lowest rates in December. It should be considered starting a theatre campaign in Summer as that suggests the highest success rate over other times of the year.

For the Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals. After close detail analyses of the amount estimated budget of £4,000, we recommend request a lower amount for budget possibly from £2000.00 to £3000.00, considering half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000.
Also, in the Great Britain’s the category Theater, as in US, is the most successful. Indicating that the Theater market is a good investment choice.

### Observation
On US campaigns the success average goal was close to pledge amount as or IQR statistics number showed, however on the failed campaigns the discrepancies are uncommonly high.
Consider check the Goal and Pledge for failed campaigns once we had found considerable amount differences.
