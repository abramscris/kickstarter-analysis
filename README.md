## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project is based on the campaigns completed by Kickstarter platform crowdfunding from the years of 2009 to 2017.The direction of this project is mainly analyzed trends on the Theater projects focused on plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to point out the differences between campaigns concentrating in plays, using the launch data dates and their funding goals. And advise on possible future campaigns goals.

### Analysis and Challenges

This project has the main goal to introduce the student to learn Excel tools to perform a great Analysis of large database, identifying trends and providing recommendations that would improve the goals of the solicitor. As we have a large scale of data, I filtered the data trying to get the most specific results as requested.

In this exercise I came across a few challenge points that were easily overcome after concentration and redoing until get the results expected, some of the challenges were:

* Recognizing data and placed on the appropriate value in order to get the information needed.
* Insure the COUNTIF was placed and displayed as instructed.
* Pivot charts that provides the accurate visualization needed for each trend.

#### Chart

### Results

Initiating the Kickstarter the perception over the Theater category has the better success rates compare to other category’s, reaffirming that Louise interest on the Theater category has potential. Furthermore, we can identify that would be recommended in order to obtained success on the project, initiate a campaign during the months of May, June or July considering that May success rates were 111 when compared to the lower months of October, November and December the best rate success was in October with 65 successful campaigns. 

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

On the chart below we can identify the successful campaigns as the highest on the months prior documented, also we can see the discrepancies between failed and canceled. We can assume that seasons of the year are a determinant factor on success rates, once seems on the months of May/June/July between Spring and Summer the numbers are 65% average successful when compared to total campaigns with only 33% Failed campaigns. On the months of October/November/December between Fall and Winter we identify 42% Failed rates with 56% success on a much lower amount of success campaigns.

### Conclusion based on Outcomes based on Goals

On this perspective of data we have a different approach of Outcomes based on goals and analyzing the expectations for funding goals required, we can recognize that the rate of success is higher for campaigns with the funding goal less than $5,000. The success ranges from campaigns with goal of less than a $1,000 up to $4,999 represent 76% to 73% comparing to campaigns with higher funding goals that didn’t achieve nearly as high of success.

### Possibilities Tables or Graphs for analysis

Diving in a little further we could develop a Pivot Table based on Outcomes concentrating the Country’s US and GB once Louise wants to have more information on those.
We can extend this analysis making comparation on the Outcomes per month and concluding from this chart that between United States and Great Britain’s the theater market had a total of 783 successful campaigns. Maintaining the trend of May/June and July having the highest success rate.

#### Total

Also, when comparing the countries United States and Great Britain's, US had a 80% failed average when GB only had a 10% average failed.

### Observation
As a final observation on US campaigns the success average goal was close to pledge amount as or IQR statistics number showed, however on the failed campaigns the discrepancies are uncommonly high.
Highly recommend to consider check the Goal and Pledge for failed campaigns once we had found considerable amount differences.
