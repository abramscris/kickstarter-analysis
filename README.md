## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project is based on the campaigns completed by Kickstarter platform crowdfunding from the years of 2009 to 2017.The direction of this project is mainly analyzed trends on the Theater projects focused on plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to point out the differences between campaigns concentrating in plays, using the launch data dates and their funding goals. And advise on possible future campaigns goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

This project has the main goal to introduce the student to learn Excel tools to perform a great Analysis of large database, identifying trends and providing recommendations that would improve the goals of the solicitor. As we have a large scale of data, I filtered the data trying to get the most specific results as requested.

In this exercise I came across a few challenge points that were easily overcome after concentration and redoing until get the results expected, some of the challenges were:

* Recognizing data and placed on the appropriate value in order to get the information needed.
* Insure the COUNTIF was placed and displayed as instructed.
* Pivot charts that provides the accurate visualization needed for each trend.

# Results

Initiating the Kickstarter the analysis perception over the Theater category has the better success rates compare to other category’s, reaffirming that Louise interest on the Theater category has potential. Furthermore, we can identify that would be recommended in order to obtained success on the project, initiate a campaign during the months of May, June or July considering that May success rates were 111 when compared to the lower months of October, November and December. The highest success was in October with 65 successful campaigns. 

# Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

On the chart below we can identify the successful campaigns as the highest on the months prior documented, also we can see the discrepancies between failed and canceled. We can assume that seasons of the year are a determinant factor on success rates, once seems on the months of May/June/July between Spring and Summer the numbers are 65% average successful when compared to total campaigns with only 33% Failed campaigns. On the months of October/November/December between Fall and Winter we identify 42% Failed rates with 56% success on a much lower amount of success campaigns.

Diving in a little further we can determine that between US and Great Britain's the Theater category is the most successful with an amount of  73% of success on US and 58% success on GB compared to the failed and canceled categorys.

For the Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals. After close detail analyses of the amount estimated budget of £4,000, we recommend request a lower amount for budget possibly from £2000.00 to £3000.00, considering half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000.
Also, in the Great Britain’s the category Theater, as in US, is the most successful. Indicating that the Theater market is a good investment choice.

### Observation
On US campaigns the success average goal was close to pledge amount as or IQR statistics number showed, however on the failed campaigns the discrepancies are uncommonly high.
Consider check the Goal and Pledge for failed campaigns once we had found considerable amount differences.
